Problem Statement Background
Floods are among the most frequent and destructive disasters, causing loss of life, damage to
property, and disruption of essential services. Climate change, extreme rainfall, rapid
urbanization, and poor drainage systems have increased flood risk in many regions. Current
flood risk assessment methods often depend on manual GIS analysis and delayed reporting,
making it difficult for authorities to identify high-risk zones early and plan preventive
actions. With the availability of satellite imagery, rainfall records, and terrain data, an AIbased solution can help detect flood-prone areas faster and support timely decision-making
for disaster preparedness and sustainable development.
Problem Statement
How might we use AI to predict flood-prone regions using multi-source environmental
data so that communities can become safer, more resilient, and sustainable?
Target Users
• Disaster management and emergency response teams
• Municipal corporations and smart city planning authorities
• Residents in flood-prone regions
• NGOs working on disaster preparedness and relief
• Researchers and students in climate/environmental studies
AI Solution Overview
This project proposes an AI-driven flood susceptibility prediction system that analyzes
multiple datasets such as rainfall, elevation, slope, land cover, and proximity to water bodies.
The system predicts risk zones and generates flood susceptibility maps to support early
warning and planning.
AI Elements Used
• Machine Learning (ML): Predicts flood risk levels (Low/Medium/High) using
geospatial and weather features.
• Agentic AI Workflow: Automates the pipeline from data input → prediction → map
generation → reporting.
• Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Retrieves disaster SOPs and government
safety guidelines to provide context-aware recommendations.
• Prompt Engineering / IBM Granite (Optional): Produces clear and explainable
summaries for users.
Workflow / Prototype
1. Input Data
o Rainfall history / forecast
o DEM (elevation and slope)
o Drainage/river network
o Land use/land cover information
2. Processing
o Feature extraction (runoff potential, slope, water proximity)
o ML-based flood susceptibility prediction
3. Outputs
o Flood risk map (Low/Medium/High)
o Risk ranking of regions
o AI-generated explanation and action plan
Expected Impact
• Faster identification of flood-prone zones
• Improved disaster preparedness and mitigation planning
• Better allocation of emergency resources
• Reduced loss of life and infrastructure damage
• Increased climate resilience for sustainable communities
Responsible AI Considerations
• Fairness: Use diverse datasets to avoid region-specific bias.
• Transparency: Provide explainable reasons behind risk predictions.
• Ethics: Avoid panic messaging; provide verified guidance only.
• Privacy: Use only public environmental and satellite datasets.
• Reliability: Mention limitations and confidence of predictions.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how AI can support climate resilience by predicting flood
susceptibility and generating actionable insights. By automating risk mapping and providing
explainable outputs, the solution helps authorities and communities take timely preventive
measures, improving safety and sustainability aligned with SDG goals.
